                  <h1 className="mt-11 font-bold text-[25px]">6.1. Your Privacy Choices</h1>
                  <p className="text-[25px] mt-4">The privacy choices you may have about your personal information are determined by applicable law and are described below.

                    (a) Email Communications.
                    If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email to opt out of receiving future emails. Note that you will continue to receive transaction-related emails regarding products or Services you have requested. We may also send you certain non-promotional communications regarding us and our Services, and you will not be able to opt out of those communications (e.g., communications regarding our Services or updates to our Terms of Use or this Privacy Notice).

                    (b) Text Messages.
                    You may opt out of receiving text messages from us by following the instructions in the text message you have received from us or by otherwise contacting us.

                    (c) Mobile Devices.
                    We may send you push notifications through our mobile app. You may opt out from receiving these push notifications by changing the settings on your mobile device. With your consent, we may also collect precise location-based information via our mobile app. You may opt out of this collection by changing the settings on your mobile device.

                    (d) “Do Not Track.”
                    Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.

                    (e) Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising.
                    You may stop or restrict the placement of Technologies on your device or remove them by adjusting your preferences as your browser or device permits. However, if you adjust your preferences, our Services may not work properly. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, you may opt-out of personalized advertisements on some mobile applications by following the instructions for Android, iOS and others. The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from data partners and other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these and learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative, the Digital Advertising Alliance, the European Digital Advertising Alliance, and the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada. Please note you must separately opt out in each browser and on each device.

                  <h1 className="mt-11 font-bold text-[25px]">6.2. Your Privacy Rights</h1>
                  <p className="text-[25px] mt-4">In accordance with applicable law, you may have the right to:
                    (a) Request access to your personal data: Commonly known as a “data subject access request,” this enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to verify that we are lawfully processing it.
                    (b) Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you: This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
                    (c) Request erasure of your personal data: This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue processing it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure for specific legal reasons, which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
                    (d) Object to processing of your personal data: This applies when we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground, as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
                    (e) Request restriction of processing of your personal data: This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
                    i. If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy;
                    ii. Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
                    iii. Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or
                    iv. You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
                    (f) Request the transfer of your personal data: We will provide your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format to you or a third party you have chosen. Please note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
                    (g) Withdraw consent: You may withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

Unfortunately, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unauthorized disclosure. By using our Services or providing personal information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of our Services.

                  <p className="text-[25px] mt-4">Many of our external third parties are based outside the UK so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK. We may transfer your personal data to our group companies that are located outside the UK, including, but not limited, in the United States, or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
                  (a) We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.
                  (b) Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the UK which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK. Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK.
